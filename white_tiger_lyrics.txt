8 ContributorsWhite Tiger Lyrics[Chorus: Hippie Sabotage]
Ow, white, white tiger
Ow, bright, blow those days
Ow, white, white tiger
Ow, bright, blow those days
I ask the God of these safety up
I ask the God of these safety up
I ask the God of these safety up
So far He made it like

[Verse 1: Hi-Rez]
I done been in the bottom with no pot to piss in
But there wasn't ain't shit that was stopping this kid
I just kept my head up and say fuck opinions
A kid with a dream on the road to riches
I done been suicidal with a gun to my head
And I'd fucking be dead if it weren't for feds
Ain't a thing that can stand in the way of my plans
Every second working hard becoming a better man
Look, Every day that you alive is a blessing
You ain't alone if you battling depression
And every mistake you make is just another lesson
Work hard every day to progression
I lost family, I lost homies
I always feel like ain't nobody know me
All alone on this road, I get lonely
I'm tryna live, God, please can you show me?

Ow, white, white tiger
Ow, bright, blow those days
Ow, white, white tiger
Ow, bright, blow those days
I ask the God of these safety up
I ask the God of these safety up
I ask the God of these safety up
So far He made it like

[Verse 2: Hi-Rez]
Everyday I still question what I'm doing
And Sometimes I feel like quitting, but I fucking keep it moving
I'm be a legend and I guarantee I'll prove it
I think I'm going insane and I hope that I don't lose my mind
I need a sign from God to tell me I'm fine
I'm doing it for the love, they doing it for the vine
I'm doing it for my fam, they do it for dollar signs
My momma got fired so you know I'm on my grind
Fuck a nine to five, I do it for the art
I represent the kids that feeling lost in the dark
And everything in they life feel like it falling apart
Never quitting what I start, I speaking right from the Heart
They rapping for the dough, they rapping just to blow
They rapping for these hoes, I just do it for the soul
I do it to inspire and to give the people hope
If it wasn't for rap, I would be hanging from a rope, muhfucker
[Chorus: Hippie Sabotage]
Ow, white, white tiger
Ow, bright, blow those days
Ow, white, white tiger
Ow, bright, blow those days
I ask the God of these safety up
I ask the God of these safety up
I ask the God of these safety up
So far He made it likeEmbed
